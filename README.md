Welcome to my little project Arduino Pong
==============

There are already some versions of pong for Arduino but no version was satisfing my needs.
So I decided to do my own implemenation.


Requirements:
--------------

- run on most of the Arduino Boards (e.g. Arduino Nano or Uno)
- be as simbple a possible (e.g build up on a Breadboard)
- support for original Atari paddles
- Video & Sound output for usual TV sets


Setup Up and compile the project:
--------------
- First of all you would need to get the project "queezythegreat/arduino-cmake" on githhub.
  I used it to set up the build environment out of the arduino IDE.
  Best to clone the repository in parallel to Arduino Pong
