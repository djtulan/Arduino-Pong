Welcome to my little project Arduino Pong
==============

There are already some versions of pong for Arduino but I was no version satisfing my needs.
So I decided to do my own implemenation.


Requirements:
--------------

- run on most of the Arduino Boards (e.g. Arduino Nano or Uno)
- be as simbple a possible (e.g build up on a Breadboard)
- support for original Atari paddles
- Video & Sound output for usual TV sets
